# Heart-Rate-Monitor
A Python Code utilizing a webcam to monitor user(s) heart rate.

About 659,000 people in the United Stated die from heart disease every year (CDC 2021). Someone in the United States has a heart attack every 40 seconds. Each and every person should be aware of how irregularities in their heart heatlh can negatively impact them. This project is especially special as one of our contributor's has firsthand experience with the impacts of heart health. Janna's mom has Congestive Heart Failure, and has both a defibrillator and pacemaker implanted. Therefore, we believe monitoring your heart rate is important because if someone's heart rate raises too high it can become a sign that medical attention is needed. 

Therefore the purpose of our coding project is to monitor user(s) heart rates. So that if there is some sort of irregularity, a person will be made aware and will then be able to take the necessary preventive medical actions to learn more about their body and heart health. We will use Python code to create an application that will aid in monitoring one's heart rate and therefore improve health outcomes nation-wide.
