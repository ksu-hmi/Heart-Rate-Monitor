# Heart-Rate-Monitor
A Python Code utilizing a webcam to monitor heart rate.

Heart Health is very important. Each and every person should be aware of how irregularities in their heart heatlh can negatively impact them. This project is especially special as one of our contributor's has firsthand experience with the impacts of in heart health. Janna's mom has Congestive Heart Failure and has both a defibrillator and pacemaker implanted. Therefore, we believe monitoring your heart rate is important because if someone's heart rate raises too high it can become a sign that medical attention is needed. 

Therefore purpose of our coding project is to monitor heart rates for everyone. So if there is some sort of irregularity, a person will be made aware and will then be able to take the necessary preventive medical actions to learn more about their body and heart health. We will use Python code to create an application that will aid in monitoring one's heart rate.
