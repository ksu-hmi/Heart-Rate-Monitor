DONE: Create a GitHub repository

DONE: Add a "readme.md" page with the description of the project to repository

DONE: Create a team in GitHub organization with the members in that team.

DONE: Create a file entitled “projectroadmap.md” in the main project code repository.

DONE: Add code example entitled: "samplecode.py"

DONE: Tested out various webcam heart rate monitors on Github utilizing Python. Learned OPEN-CV is necessary to call the computer's webcam.

DONE: During testing, inferred that some of these heart rate monitors do not work on Python version 3. As in earlier Python and Open-CV versions, there was only cv. So these older codes are calling import cv. Later, OpenCV came with both cv and cv2. Now, there in the latest releases, there is only the cv2 module, and cv is a subclass inside cv2. So you need to call import cv2.cv as cv to access it.

DONE: Updated this section fb65e874f1a7422b0eb804c6c09f4b3644d53db4 to further clarify the code and explain what the code was doing
